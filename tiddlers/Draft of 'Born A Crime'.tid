title: Draft of 'Born A Crime'
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This is not a review of Trevor Noah's eponymous book, but rather a story of my own.

I've recounted this story countless times to those unfamiliar with the background I was born into, and it deserves to be written down.

I was born in 1990, after my parents had already had two daughters. They continued trying for a son.

This was a crime with severe consequences. However, the societal stigma of not having a son was far more unbearable than the state's punishment, so my parents were willing to face the latter.

By the time my second sister was born, my family had already violated the One Child Policy. The village chief, who had also violated the policy, blocked the enforcers from entering our village to protect himself. This temporarily saved my family.

When I was born, the village chief could no longer shield the village. My family had to pay the accumulated fine for violating the policy. The amount was impossibly large for my parents, who were extremely poor with little income.

The state did not grant leniency because we were poor. To enforce compliance, those who violated the policy were punished with petty cruelty.

Our family's punishment was the demolition of our tiny shelter—a shabby hut, barely a house—while we had a newborn.

A side note: When the enforcers came to demolish our home, my grandfather greeted them. He offered cigarettes to the officials and told them to show no mercy. The leader of the group became enraged and scolded my grandfather:


<<<
You old bastard! Other grandfathers beg for mercy for their sons and grandsons. You're the first I've met who asks for more punishment!
(你这老狗日的！别人添孙子都会给计生办求情，你还来告状！)
<<<


Four years later, my family decided to leave our hometown in search of better living conditions. The farmland was so barren that we could not survive by farming.

To relocate, they needed a certificate proving they hadn't violated the One Child Policy.

My mother, who was illiterate and had never attended school, struggled to understand and memorize formal Chinese. However, when I asked her about this story, she recited the certificate's name word for word: 流动人口计划生育合格证 (Planned Birth Certificate for Migrants).

To clear our records, my father took out a loan to pay the fine.

In the end, my family still had to pay the fine, even after the state had destroyed our home.

Three decades later, when I read news about China having trouble in getting people to have more babies, I couldn't help but think of a German word I recently learned: Schadenfreude.
